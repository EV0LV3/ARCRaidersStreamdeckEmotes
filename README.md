# ARC Raiders Streamdeck Emotes Macros
Communication in ARC is key, but sometimes I’m not in the mood to speak, and then emotes are nice to use.
Pressing G and then using my mouse to select the right emote is annoying, and since I already have my Stream Deck next to me, why not use that instead :)

### Requierments
- SuperMacro from BarRaider: https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/supermacro-62195fec-7bcb-403d-b650-c342e9dfec67

### Profile
This profile is built for a Stream Deck + but can easily be used on other versions too.

### Set-up
1. Download and install the SuperMacro plugin
2. Import the profile
3. Make changes to your liking.

### Modify
I use the default emotes, but if you want to make some changes, that is possible. Below you’ll find the coordinates for the macro.

1. Open one of the macros
2. Go to the macro field
3. Change the X and Y in {{MOUSEMOVE:X,Y}} with one of the values below.

| Direction        | X     | Y     |
|------------------|-------|-------|
| Top              | 0     | -100  |
| Top-Right        | 70    | -70   |
| Right            | 100   | 0     |
| Bottom-Right     | 70    | 70    |
| Bottom           | 0     | 100   |
| Bottom-Left      | -70   | 70    |
| Left             | -100  | 0     |
